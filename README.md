# svd-ft-image-compression-analysis
An analysis of Singular Value Decomposition &amp; Fourier Transform as dimensionality reduction algorithms applied to image compression tasks.

The goal of this project is to analyze and conclude whether SVD or FT image compression yields compressed images of higher image quality. The computational efficiency of each algorithm is also taken into account for fairer analyses.

Our dataset of images was obtained from Scikit-Learn’s skimage.data API, specifically from their “General-purpose images” collection.

The two algorithms were implemented using the SVD and FFT functions in the Numpy library.
